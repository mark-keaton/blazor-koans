# Task: Documentation and Verification

## Description
Create comprehensive README documentation and verify the complete koan experience works correctly. Ensure all 48 tests fail initially and pass when solutions are applied.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md with setup instructions, learning path, and usage guide
- [ ] All 48 tests fail when run with placeholder values
- [ ] All 48 tests pass when solutions are uncommented
- [ ] Test filtering by category works correctly
- [ ] `dotnet test` returns exit code 1 (failure) in initial state
- [ ] App runs and displays components correctly

## Technical Details

### README Sections
1. **Introduction** - What is Blazor Koans, who is it for
2. **Prerequisites** - .NET 10 SDK, IDE recommendations
3. **Quick Start** - Clone, run first test, see it fail
4. **Learning Path** - 3-week curriculum overview
5. **How to Use** - Run tests, fix code, verify, repeat
6. **Running Tests** - Full suite, by category, by topic
7. **Getting Stuck** - How to find solution comments
8. **Contributing** - How to add new koans

### Verification Checklist
```bash
# 1. Fresh clone state - all tests fail
dotnet test
# Expected: 48 failed, 0 passed

# 2. Filter by level
dotnet test --filter "Category=Beginner"    # 16 fail
dotnet test --filter "Category=Intermediate" # 16 fail
dotnet test --filter "Category=Advanced"     # 16 fail

# 3. Apply solutions and verify
# (Uncomment SOLUTION lines in each test)
dotnet test
# Expected: 0 failed, 48 passed

# 4. App runs
cd src/BlazorKoans.App
dotnet run
# Expected: Blazor app starts on https://localhost:5001
```

### Test Suite Verification
| Category | Tests | Initial State | With Solutions |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Beginner | 16 | All fail | All pass |
| Intermediate | 16 | All fail | All pass |
| Advanced | 16 | All fail | All pass |
| **Total** | **48** | **48 fail** | **48 pass** |

### Performance Verification
- Full test suite completes in < 30 seconds
- Individual tests run in < 1 second
- App startup in < 3 seconds

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Project Scaffolding) complete
- [ ] Task 002 (Beginner Koans) complete
- [ ] Task 003 (Intermediate Koans) complete
- [ ] Task 004 (Advanced Koans) complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 3
- Parallel: false (must run after all koans complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] README.md is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Verification script confirms all tests work correctly
- [ ] No compiler warnings in solution
- [ ] App runs without errors
- [ ] Learning path is clear and achievable
